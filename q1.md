### Question 1 - The Subsequence Problem
Data-structure for some string $T$ which supports query `subsequence(P)` to test if some string $P$ is a subsequence of $T$.
#### Solution for 1.1

##### Data-structure
A data-structure which supports the `Subsequence(P)` query stores pointers from each letter in $T$ to the next occurrence in $T$ of every letter in the alphabet.

Let $A$ be an array of length $n + 1$. $A$ contains hash-tables hashed over alphabet, $\sigma$. Each key-value pair $(k,v)$ in the hash-table contains some letter $k$ as key and it's next occurrence as value $v$.

* The hash-table $A_0$ contains the first occurrence of every letter in the alphabet.

* The hash-table $A_1$ contains the index of second occurrence for the letter at $T_0$ along with the first occurrence of the other letters.

* The hash-table $A_2$ contains the index of second occurrence for the letters $T_1$ and $T_2$ assuming they are different letters - otherwise $A_2$ will contain the third index of the letter at $T_1$ - along with the first occurrence of the other letters and so on...

Example: If $T$ is `B C A D F B`, $¥$ represents the hashtable $A_0$ and represents a **Ø** null pointer, the data-structure would look like:
```
 |0 1 2 3 4 5
 |¥ B C A D B
A|3 3 3 Ø Ø Ø
B|1 5 5 5 5 Ø
C|2 2 Ø Ø Ø Ø
D|4 4 4 4 Ø Ø
```

The alphabet $\sigma$ is built from the letters in $T$ and is static. Therefore, perfect hashing (FKS) can be used.

##### Running the query
To perform the `Subsequence(P)` query with the string $P$, we lookup the $A$-index of the first occurrence $P_0$ in $T$ using $A_0$.

In the example we could query `Subsequence("BAB")` to test if `BAB` is a subsequence:
* look-up `B` in column 0 which returns index 1
* look-up `A` in column 1 which returns index 3
* look-up `B` in column 3 which returns index 5

As long as we don't pass a null-pointer, the string is subsequence. The hash-lookups take constant time and we have to perform at most $|P|$ of them the runtime is $O(|P|)$.

The space consumption is $O(|P|\cdot|T|)$

#### Solution for 1.2
Building the data-structure.
* For each character, **c**, in **T** an array of indices at which **c** occurs in **T** is constructed.
* Each array is converted to a Y-fast-trie, **Y** for fast successor queries.
* The Y-fast-tries are stored in a hash-table, **H**, with the corresponding characters as keys. As the alphabet of **T** is static, perfect hashing can be used.

##### Running the query
To perform the `Subsequence(P)` query on the data-structure:
* For the first character, **c_0** in **P**, look-up the Y-fast trie,**Y**, in **H** corresponding to **c_0**.
* Take the min in **Y**, which is the index of **c_0**'s first occurrence in **T**.
* Thereafter take the **H** corresponding to the next character, **c_1**, in **P**. In that **H** find the successor to the index of **c_0**.
* Continue finding successors to the index of the previous characters in the Y-fast-trie of next character until, no successor is found - in which case **P** is not a subsequence - or until all letters in **P** have been iterated over - in which case **P** *is* a subsequence.

##### Performance

Finding the successor in a Y-fast-trie takes `O(log(log(U)))`. However, the universe of index arrays is at most the length of **T**. Therefore the successor query takes `O(log log |T|)`.

Looking up the Y-fast-trie for some letter **c** in **H** takes constant time `O(1)` and has to be done a total of `|P|` times. Thus the overall runtime of `Subsequence(P)` on the datastrucure built from **T**, takes `O(|P| log log |T|)`.

Y-fast-tries are have the same length as the arrays they represent. The sum of our the arrays is equal to the length of **T**. Storing the tries in a hash-table does not add any space consumption. Thus in all the space consumption is `O(|T|)`.

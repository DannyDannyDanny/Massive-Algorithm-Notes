### Question 7 - String Reversal

Let S be a string of length $N$ stored in $O(N/B)$ blocks.

We want to compute the reverse string $S^R$ of $S$.


#### Algorithm to reverse S in the I/O model.

$B$ is I/O block size and $n$ is Length of string $S$

* Divide $S$ into substrings - such that any two substrings can be loaded in one I/O.
* Read the first and last substrings into memory and reverse each substring.
* Write the reversed substrings each to the others original position.
* Working inwards, repeat the process for each pair of substrings until S has been reversed.

The whole process takes $O(n/B)$ I/Os.

#### Algorithm to reverse S in the cache oblivious model.

* Half the string into substrings recursively until any two substrings fit into **memory**.
* Read the first and last substrings into memory and reverse each substring.
* Write the reversed substrings each to the others original position.
* Working inwards, repeat the process for each pair of substrings until S has been reversed.

The algorithms runs in $O(n/M)$ I/Os

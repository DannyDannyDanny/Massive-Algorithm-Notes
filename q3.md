### Question 3 - Placement of Bars

See q3 - resources

A 3-approximation algorithm that given...
* a budget **B**
* **n** nodes each with some price **p_j**

...can place bars at nodes such that no node is *too* far from any bar.


Consider the nodes as a graph, **G=(V,E)**



The
* Minimal dominating sets can be found in polynomial time.

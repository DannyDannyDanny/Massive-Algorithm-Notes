### Question 5

#### Longest common prefix phrase

Assuming the phrases $P1$, and $P2$ are phrases in the LZ78 encoding of $T$ and are given as indices in the LZ78 trie:

A data-structure for some string $T$, supporting the $LCPP$ operation can be can be constructed with the help of a hash table, a depth array and by considering the operation as a Lowest Common Ancestor ($LCA$) problem.

* Consider the LZ78 trie as a rooted tree, $S$.

* Each phrase in $T$ has a corresponding node in $S$.

* The $LCA$ node of two nodes in $S$ corresponds to longest prefix of two phrases in $T$.
* To quickly perform LCA, we reduce the problem to a ±RMQ by performing a Euler Tour of $S$ storing each node alongside its depth in an array, $A$.

* A hash table (FKS dictionary), $H$, points each phrase in $T$ to each node in $S$.

To perform $LCPP(P1,P2)$, use $H$ to find their indices in $A$. Perform $LCA$ using $A$ returning the node id.

In the case that $P1$ is a prefix of $P2$ or v.v, the nodes corresponding to the phrases $P1$ and $P2$ share ancestry. Thus $LCA$ will return one of the nodes, $Px$. To which we return $Px$'s parent.

Performing this query requires two hash-table lookups, a $LCA$ query and in some cases a parent-lookup. Each of these sub-operations takes constant time using the data-structure. Thus the operation has a time complexity of $O(1)$.

The space consumption for $H$, $S$ and $A$ is $O(n) + O(n) + O(2·n)$ which is $O(n)$ overall.

#### Longest common extension phrase
Let $S$ denote the LZ78 trie. For each node, $a$, in $S$, exists a phrase, $b$, in $T$.

* For each phrase-node pair, $b$-$a$:
  * At $a$ in the tree $S$, store $b$'s start index in $T$. We denote this index at each node as its $b_T$ index.

To perform the operation $LCEF(x)$:

1. Find $K$, the suffix of $T$ starting at position $x$.

> Given $x$ find the node $a$ with the greatest $b_T$ smaller than $x$. Decode $T$ from $a$ i.e $b_T$ and remove $(x - b_T)$ letters from the font of the decoded string.

2. Find id of the longest phrase that is a prefix of $K$.

> Traverse the characters in $K$ while traveling downwards from the root of $S$ following the edges marked with the characters in $K$ until reaching a leaf node or a node which does not have an edge marked with the next character. Return the id of that node.

The time taken to perform $LCEF(x)$ consists of:
* finding the $a$ with the highest $b_T$ - time: $O(n)$
* decode from $a$ until the end of $T$ - time: $O(n)$
* remove $(x - b_T)$ from the front of the decoded string - yielding $K$ - time: $O(1)$
* traversing the characters in $K$ and the nodes in $S$ - time: $O(n)$

...thus giving an overall time complexity of $O(n)$.

The extra information stored at each node keeps the space consumption at $O(n)$

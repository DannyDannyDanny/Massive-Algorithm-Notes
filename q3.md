### Question 3 - Placement of Bars

See q3 - resources

A 3-approximation algorithm that given...
* a budget **B**
* **n** nodes each with some price **p_j**

...can place bars at nodes such that no node is *too* far from any bar.

* Complete weighted graph, $G=(V,E)$
  * Edge costs $c: E \to Q^+$
  * Node costs $p: V \to Q^+$
* We have a budget $B$ to place some number of bars.
* For some subset $S \subseteq V$ and some node $v \in V$, we denote the cheapest path from $v$ to any node in $S$ by $c(v,S)$.
* We want to find a set $S \subseteq V$ for which the combined price of the nodes does not exceed the budget: $\sum_{s \in S}{p(s)} \leq B$ while minimizing $\underset{v \in V}{\max}c(v,S,)$
* K-center problem is NP-hard but can be reduced to a maximal independent set problem - which **can** be solved in polynomial time.


#### Pruning $G$ to $G_1,G_2,...,G_m$
* The list of edges can be expressed as a sorted list of edges from cheapest to most expensive: $E=[e_1,e_2,...,e_m]$ such that $c(e_1) \leq c(e_1) \leq ... c(e_m)$.
* A sub set of $E$ takes the first $i$ cheapest edges and is denoted $E_i=[e_1,e_2,...,e_i]$
* The pruned graph composed of $E_i$ is denoted $G_i=(V,E_i)$.
* This K-center problem is equivalent to finding the smallest $i$ such that $G_i$ is a dominating set and does not exceed the budget $\sum_{s \in S}{p(s)} \leq B$

#### Dominating set $dom(G)$
* A subset of nodes in a graph who collectively have edges to all other nodes in the graph.
* i.e The set $S \subseteq V$ is considered a dominating set if every node in $V-S$ is adjacent to a node in $S$.
* Let $\text{dom}(g)$ denote the smallest dominating set in $G$.

#### Squaring the graph: $G^2$
* The set of edges $E^2$ has additional edges for all paths of length 2 or less. All paths between any two nodes $\{e_{uv} | \{u,v\} \in E\}$ if there exists a path of length at most two connecting $u$ and $v$.
* The squared graph of $G$ is denoted $G^{2}=(V,E^2)$.
* The cost of any edge in $E^2$ is:
  * 1 if the edge previously existed in $E$
  * 2 if the edge did not exist in $E$
$$\text{c}(e_{u v})=
\begin{cases}
1,  & \text{if $e_{uv} \in E$}\\
2,  & \text{if $e_{uv} \notin E$}
\end{cases}$$

#### Independent Set
* A set $I$ is an independent if $\{I \subseteq V | e_{u v} \notin E | \}$ i.e no two nodes connected are connected by an edge.

#### Weight of a set $w(s)$
In some set $S \subseteq V$, Let the sum of node costs of that set, $\sum_{s \in S}p(s)$ be denoted $w(S)$.

#### Lightest Neighbor operation $s(u)$
For any node $u$, let $\text{s}(u)$ be the its cheapest neighbor. In the case that $u$ is cheaper than all it's neighbors $s(u)=u$. In a pruned graph, $G_i$, the operation is denoted $\text{s}_i(u)$.

#### Lemma 1: Maximal independent sets
* A maximal independent set can be computed in polynomial time

#### Lemma 2: Independent Sets - Minimal dominating Sets
* A (maximal) independent set in $G^2$ is a (minimal) dominating set in $G$
* Identically a clique in $G$ becomes a start $G$

#### Lemma 3: Dominating set vs Cheapest neighbor set
* Let $S=\{\text{s}(u)|u \in I\}$, where $I$ is an independent set in $G^2$.
* Let $H$ be a minimum-weight dominating set in $G$
* There are $|H|$ stars in $G$ and $|H|$ cliques in $G^2$.
* Each node in $I$ is the center of a star in $G$. Each node is most likely not the cheapest node in the star.
* Building $S$ from $I$ gives a set which is at least just as light as $H$. Thus we get $w(s) \leq w(\text{dom}(G))$

#### 3-approximation algorithm
* Construct squared graphs for all possible pruned graphs $G_1^2,G_2^2,...,G_m^2$
* Compute maximal independent set $M_i$ set for each graph $G_i^2$
* Compute $S_i = \{\text{s}_i(u)|u \in M_i\}$
* Find the smallest index $i$, denoted $j$, so that the sum of nodes prices in $M_j$ don't exceed the budget: $\sum_{e \in M_j}{p(e)} \leq B$
* Return $M_j$


#### Analysis
* $M_j$ is a dominating set in $G^2$ and a maximal independent set in $G$.
* The stars in $G_j^2$ - when centered over the nodes in $M_j$ - can cover all nodes in $G$.
* The edges of the stars cost at most $2 \cdot \text{c}(e_{uv})$
* The center of each star at most $\text{c}(e_j)$ to a node in $S_j$,
* Thus every node in $G_j$ can be reached by a cost of at most $3 \cdot \text{c}(e_j)$

* From the pruning process, the longest edge in the pruned graph is $e_j$ thus we get that $c(e_j)\leq r$
* Thus every node can reached by a cost cost of at most $3 \cdot r$, making the algorithm a three-approximation for the weighted K-center problem.

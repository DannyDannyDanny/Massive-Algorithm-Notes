### Question 6 - 2D Range Numbering

A data-structure that supports to the query **number(R=((x1,y1),(x2,y2)))**

* Build a tree, **T**, over the the x-range with a child leaf node for each unique x-value
* Traverse each point **p** in **P**. Store the y-value of **p** in an sorted array at the leaf node corresponding to **p**'s x-value.
* Each parent node in **T**, stores a sorted array containing the all of the y-values contained in the child nodes' y-value arrays.

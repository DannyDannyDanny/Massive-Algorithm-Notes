### Question 2 - The Highest α-Free Ancestor Problem

Let $T$ be a rooted tree with $n$ nodes. Each leaf in $T$ is assigned a label from a set of colors $C$.
* Perform Euler Tour of **T**, storing the resulting array, **E** containing the index and depth of each node.
* Construct a hash-table, **H**, where key-value pairs have some color-label, **{c | c ∈ C}**, as key and the indices at which **c** occurs as value.
* The values in **H** (color indices) are stored as y-fast-tries for fast successor and predecessor queries.

To perform **HFA(l,ɑ)**, get the indices of color-label, **l**, in the y-fast-trie **H[l]**
* Find the successor node **s** and predecessor node **p** to **ɑ** in **H[l]**.
* Either **p** or **s** in **H[l]** will be the most closely related node with label **l**.
* Find the depth of the lowest common ancestor of **s**-**ɑ** and **p**-**ɑ** using plus-minus-RMQ on **E**.
* Of the resulting nodes, **LCA(ɑ,p)** and **LCA(ɑ,s)**, choose the node deepest in the tree and return the child which is an ancestor to **ɑ**.

Performing **HFA(l,ɑ)** requires:
* look-up in **H** - constant time
* successor and predecessor queries - **O(log log n)** time
* LCA on both successor and predecessor - constant time.
* Finding the deepest LCA and returning its child / ancestor to **ɑ** - constant time.
All in all the combined time complexity is **O(log log n)**.

Constructing the data-structure requires storign:
* **T**, The original tree **O(n)**,
* **E**, Array from Euler Tour **O(2·n)**
* **H**, Hash table with y-fast-tries containing indices of color-labels **O(C+n)**. As **C≤N** this takes **O(n)** space.
Combined this gives a combined space consumption of **O(n)**.

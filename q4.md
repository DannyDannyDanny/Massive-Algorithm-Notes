### Question 4 Maximal Super-suffix

The number of occurrences in $S$, of each suffix in $P$ is stored in a hash-table $H$. For each key-value pair the suffix string is a key and the number of occurrences is a value.
All occurrences are initialized to zero.
To count number of occurrences of each suffix, walk left over $S$ from the right. Upon passing a suffix, increment it's occurrence in $H$.
Once $S$ has been iterated, iterate over $H$ to find the suffix(es) the longest suffix that occurs at least as many times as any other suffix.


Let $S=\text{ZIMZOMZAM}$ and $P=\text{MOMZ}$.

From $P$ we get the following prefixes:
$\text{MOMZ}$
$\text{OMZ}$
$\text{MZ}$
$\text{Z}$

Walking left over $S$, and underlining the prefixes in $S$ while tallying them in $H$ yields the following underlining:

$\text{\underline{M\underline{Z}}I\underline{M\underline{Z}}\underline{O\underline{M\underline{Z}}}AM}$

...and the following hash-table $H$:

$$
\begin{array}{c|cc}
  \text{MOMZ}&0\\
  \text{OMZ}&1\\
  \underline{\textbf{MZ}}&\underline{\textbf{3}}\\
  \text{Z}&3
\end{array}
$$

The longest equally-most occurring string to be returned is MZ

In the illustration above, the suffix 'MZ' would be returned.

#### Performance
The algorithm iterates over $S$ which takes $O(|S|)$ time. Constructing the suffixes, hash-table and thereafter iterating over $H$ takes $O(2Â·|P|)$. Thus the entire algorithm runs with $O(|S|+|P|)$ time complexity.

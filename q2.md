### Question 2 - The Highest α-Free Ancestor Problem

Let $T$ be a rooted tree with $n$ nodes. Each leaf in $T$ is assigned a label from a set of colors $C$. Given a node $v ∈ T$, the subtree rooted at $v$, denoted $T(v)$, is the tree consisting of $v$ and all descendants of $v$. A subtree $T(v)$ is $α$-free if it does not contain a leaf with label $α$. We are interested in efficient data structures for $T$ that support the following query. Let $l$ be a leaf in $T$ and $α$ a color in $C$.

$HFA(l, α)$: return the highest ancestor $a$ of $l$ such that $T(a)$ is $α$-free.

Give a linear-space data structure for $T$ that supports fast $HFA$ queries. Ignore the preprocessing time.

#### Solution in $O(\log(n))$ time

##### Solution v.1
No additional changes are made to the original tree. To perform $HFA(\alpha,l)$:

* Start at leaf $l$
* Examine all siblings
  * If any siblings have color $\alpha$ return leaf node $l$
  * Otherwise continue to parents
* if all children are ⍺-free continue to the grandparents and check grand-children
* Continue recursively checking greater-grandparents and all greater-grandchildren until the the subtree at some grandparent is no longer \alpha-free.

Ideas for alternative solution: Find most closely related alpha node and do LCA. Return LCA nodes child on $l$'s side.
